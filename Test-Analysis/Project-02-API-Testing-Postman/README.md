# Project Title: API Testing with Postman

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases API validation using Postman collections and Newman reports.  
The objective was to ensure API reliability and reduce defects in integration layers.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
- APIs lacked consistent validation  
- Manual testing missed edge cases  
- Needed automated regression testing for APIs  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Postman (API collections)  
- Newman (automated test execution)  
- Jenkins (pipeline integration)  

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Designed Postman collections for core APIs  
2. Automated regression runs with Newman  
3. Integrated API tests into Jenkins pipeline  
4. Generated reports for stakeholders  

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- Postman collections  
- Newman test reports  
- API documentation  

---

## 🚀 Results & Impact
- Improved API reliability and defect detection  
- Reduced manual API testing effort by **50%**  
- Delivered audit-ready API test reports
