# Project Title: SQL Insights

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases SQL-based analysis for a ficticious company "ABC Retail Company Ltd" that sells electro-domestic products in Australia. Initially SQLs have been used to populate with dummy data the tables use by the system. Later other SQL procedures have been developed to validate and calculate financial transactions, and uncover compliance risks.
