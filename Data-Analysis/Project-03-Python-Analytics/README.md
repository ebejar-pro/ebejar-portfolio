# Project Title: Python Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases Python-based analytics and ETL validation.  
The objective was to [business problem, e.g., clean raw datasets and generate exploratory insights].

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
- Raw datasets contained missing values and inconsistencies  
- Needed automated cleaning and validation  
- Required exploratory analysis for trend identification  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebooks (analysis and visualization)  
- SQL (optional data extraction)  

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Imported and cleaned datasets using Pandas  
2. Applied validation rules to ensure data integrity  
3. Conducted exploratory analysis with visualizations  
4. Documented workflows in Jupyter notebooks  

---

## 📈 Deliverables
- Jupyter notebooks with analysis  
- Python scripts for ETL and cleaning  
- Visual reports (charts, plots)  

---

## 🚀 Results & Impact
- Automated data cleaning reduced manual effort by **60%**  
- Improved accuracy of downstream reporting  
- Delivered clear insights into trends and anomalies
